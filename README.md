# ChattyApp (server module)

This is the server component of my ChattyApp project, a real-time web chatroom.
the Client component of this project lives [here](https://github.com/grey275/ChattyApp).

## initial Dependencies

```
git
node >=12.3.1
```

If you have `nvm` installed(the lighthouse vagrant machine has this) you can easily install and switch to the correct version like this:

```
nvm install 12.3.1
nvm use 12.3.1
```

If `node -V` is now outputting `v12.3.1`, you're good to go!

## Setup for the Server

```
git clone https://github.com/grey275/chatty_server
cd chatty_server
npm install
npm start
```

_Now go to the [ChattyApp](https://github.com/grey275/ChattyApp) repo to run the client!_
